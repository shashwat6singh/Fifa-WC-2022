# Fifa-WC-2022 EDA
I have undertaken exploratory data analysis of Fifa World Cup 2022. This was a project driven by my interest for football. I have been following football since long but this world cup was really close to my heart. In this, I mostly derived data for Argentina's matches. I have used different parameters to analyse Argentina's perforomance. I have also compared the performance of Argentina on these indicators like possession, goal scored etc to other semifinalists and finalist nation. The complete data analysis of Argentina's performance can be found in the csv file containing SQL commands.

The project also involved exploratory data analysis conducted on the Fifa World Cup 2022 dataset which is attached in the repository using python. The steps involved data cleaning, data analysis and data visualisation. All of this was done using python libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib library. This data analysis wasn't restricted to Argentina's matches. It involved finding relation between different indicators given in the dataset. It also involved gauging the performance of each country at the World Cup.

The detailed methodology used can be found attached with the description of each of the files uploaded.
